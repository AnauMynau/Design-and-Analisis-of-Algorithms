# Design and Analysis of Algorithms ‚Äì Sorting and Selection

## üìå Architecture Notes
In this project, we implemented and analyzed several algorithms:
- **MergeSort** (with cutoff to InsertionSort, buffer reuse).
- **QuickSort** (randomized pivot, smaller-first recursion).
- **Deterministic Select (Median-of-Medians)**.
- **Closest Pair of Points** (divide-and-conquer).

We used a **metrics class** to track recursion depth and operations.  
This allowed us to measure not only execution time but also recursion behavior (e.g., verifying that QuickSort depth is bounded by `~2 * floor(log‚ÇÇ n)` with randomized pivots).

## üìä Recurrence Analysis
Here we give the recurrence and asymptotic analysis for each algorithm.

### MergeSort
- **Recurrence:**  
  T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Œò(n)  
- **Result (Master Theorem):** Œò(n log n).  
- Cutoff to InsertionSort improves constant factors for small `n`.

### QuickSort (randomized pivot)
- **Recurrence (expected):**  
  T(n) = T(Œ±n) + T((1-Œ±)n) + Œò(n), where pivot splits randomly.  
- **Result:** Œò(n log n) on average; depth bounded by `O(log n)` with high probability.  
- Worst-case Œò(n¬≤), but randomized pivot avoids adversarial input.

### Deterministic Select (Median-of-Medians)
- **Recurrence:**  
  T(n) = T(n/5) + T(7n/10) + Œò(n).  
- **Result (Akra‚ÄìBazzi):** Œò(n).  
- Guarantees linear worst-case selection.

### Closest Pair of Points
- **Recurrence:**  
  T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Œò(n).  
- **Result:** Œò(n log n).  
- Uses divide-and-conquer with strip merging.

## üìà Experimental Results

We measured execution time in **nanoseconds** using `System.nanoTime()`.  
Results were saved to `results.csv` and visualized in Excel.

## üìù Summary
- **MergeSort vs QuickSort:** Both scale as Œò(n log n), but QuickSort is slightly faster for medium `n` due to cache locality, while MergeSort is more stable.  
- **Select:** Linear time confirmed in practice, though with larger constants.  
- **Closest Pair:** Shows expected Œò(n log n) scaling, but constants are large due to recursive overhead.  
- **Theory vs Experiment:** Results match theoretical complexity. Minor deviations explained by JVM overhead, caching, and constant-factor effects.
